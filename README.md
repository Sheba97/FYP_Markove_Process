# FYP_Markove_Process

This is on project related to Developing a Markov model to calculate more accurate values for mean downtimes (MDT) used in distribution system reliability evaluation studies. The calculated mean downtime and failure rate will be used to obtain the reliability indices (SAIFI & SAIDI). The scope of this project is to develop a Markov model-based algorithm to determine the MDT for 11kV distribution feeders.
